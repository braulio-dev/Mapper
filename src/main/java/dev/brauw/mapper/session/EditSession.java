/**
 * The editable state of one world's regions, shared by everyone editing that world.
 * <p>
 * A session is keyed by <em>world</em>, not by player, because the world is already the unit on
 * disk - {@code /mapper save} writes one regions file per world. Giving each editor a private copy
 * of that file would let two people load the same regions, both add to their own copy, and have the
 * second save silently discard the first's work. There is exactly one in-memory copy per world, so
 * there is nothing to diverge.
 * <p>
 * Membership is what makes the session visible: joining shows every region to the joining player,
 * leaving hides them again, and every mutation is pushed to all online members immediately. Who may
 * mutate is decided by {@link SessionRole}.
